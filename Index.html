<p> As the COVID-19 pandemic started to surge, a saty-at-home order was announced to keep people safe during the pandemic. As a result, many businesses such as movie theaters had to close down which resulted in a lost in sales in the movie industry. This also resulted in many Americans subscribing to streaming services to watch movies and shows at the confort of their own home.</p>
<p> However, with many Americans taking the vaccine to return to everyday life, the movie theater business is doing everything it can to get people to regularly attend the movie theaters just like pre-pandemic. This come with movie theaters practicing safety measures such as restricting capcity in each theater, checking movie-goers temperature, disfinecting objects between movies, and requiring movie-goers to wear masks if their not vaccinated. New movie trailers are now even encouraging the public to go back to the movies to watch these epic action movies on the big screen. Now, we will see if these tactics made the public comfortable again to go to the movies and how sales are compared to based on pre-COVID-19.</p>

<h2> Popcorn </h2>

<p> Most Americans cannot watch a film without eating a bag of popcorn in movie theaters. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic started to surge, Americans had to use homemade popcorn. According to Gary Smith, President of Jolly Time Popcorn. microwave popcorn sales grew 40% to 50%, which made business increase up to 70% to 80%. Before the pandemic, popcorn concession stands genereated $1.7 million in revenue. Now, popcorn sales went down to a total of $288 million as a result of the pandemic. However, there's hope because study shows that now, moviegoers are consuming much more food and beverages as the average revenue for people to spend on food and beverages went up from $4.76 in 2020 to $7.37 in 2021. </p>

<h2> Attendance </h2>

<p> The movie theater industry took a huge hit during the pandemic as a stay-at-home order was released. This resulted in the increase of TV and movie streaming sites subscription so, people can enjoy these luxeries at the comfort of her own home. Netflix alone have reported that they attracted over 200 million users worldwide. However streaming services do not benefit movie theaters as the amount of movie tickets being sold in 2020 was 223,592,795. However, the good news is in 2021 tickets sales went up to 358,660,716 meaning that more people are going to movie theaters. But, these movie ticket sales don't compare to 2019 as a whooping number of 1,228,763,382 movie tickets were sold pre-COVID-19.


<h2> Box Office Revenue </h2>

<p> As expected, with less people going to the theater during the pandemic, box office revenue sales would go down drastically. This is why, many movie dosributors decided to release movies both on streaming services and movie theaters at the same time. According to Variety, the box office is still down 81% from pre-pandemic, with the highest bo office revenue in 2021 being $1.05 billion. Thanks to the success of Marvel Stuidios putting out Avengers Endgame, Captain Marvel, and Spiderman: ar From Home, in July 2019, the box offic hit 5.6 billion in 2019, which is still a far cry when compared to box office revenue now. </p>

<h2> Movies Releases </h2>

<p> The pandemic caused there to be fewer movie releases as production was haulted and many movie stuidos held releasing their film until the pandemic was over. However, according to Forbes, only 338 movies were released in 2020 which is a decline from the 987 movies that was released in 2019. More movies are being released now as many people are getting vaccinated to return to everyday life as most recently, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the top movie this year making $255 million globally </p>
